It only compares 2 files if they have same name and are in different folders â€” one file in the "Input1" folder and the other in the "Input2" folder.

## How to Use

1. Put all your `.xml` files of set 1 in the `Input1` folder.  
2. Put all your `.xml` files of set 2 in the `Input2` folder.  
3. Run the script `compare_script.py`.  
4. Your results will be saved in a folder named like `Result_<date_time>`, with each result having the same name as the compared `.xml` file.
